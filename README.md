# Weather app

A weather application written in Vue.js using the openweathermap API
for weather forecasting and the Google Places API for getting photos
of places.

## Steps to start a project locally:

To run a Vue.js project, you will need to have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the Vue CLI 
(npm install -g @vue/cli) installed on your machine.

Download project and run the command
```
npm install
```
in the root directory in your terminal for downloading packages.

After successful installation, you need to start the local server
```
npm run serve
```
the address should be http://localhost:8080, it's 
in the permissions of my API key.

Finally, you need to rename '.env.test' to '.env' or create new '.env' file.
You need to substitute API keys in it.

Well done! I hope it worked :)
