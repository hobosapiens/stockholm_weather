# Weather app with google-map photos of location
(google API key required)

A weather application written in Vue.js using the OpenWeatherMap API
for weather forecasting and the Google Places API for getting photos
of places.

## Steps to start a project locally:

To run a Vue.js project, you will need to have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the Vue CLI 
(npm install -g @vue/cli) installed on your machine.

Download project and run the command
```
npm install
```
in the root directory in your terminal for downloading packages.

After successful installation, you need to rename '.env.test' to '.env' or create new '.env' file.
You need to substitute API keys in it.

Finally, you need to start the local server
```
npm run serve
```
and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

Well done! I hope it worked :)
